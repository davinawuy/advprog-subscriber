## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a Rocket web framework skeleton that you can work with.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement a feature: `Notification`.
This feature will receive notifications of creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, when this receiver instance is subscribed to a certain product type.
The notification will be sent using HTTP POST request, so you need to make the receiver endpoint in this project.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Receiver" folder.

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    ROCKET_PORT=8001
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:${ROCKET_PORT}
    APP_PUBLISHER_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8000
    APP_INSTANCE_NAME=Safira Sudrajat
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable                | type   | description                                                     |
    |-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ROCKET_PORT             | string | Port number that will be listened by this receiver instance.    |
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL   | string | URL address where this receiver instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_PUUBLISHER_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where the publisher instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_INSTANCE_NAME       | string | Name of this receiver instance, will be shown on notifications. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)
3.  To simulate multiple instances of BambangShop Receiver (as the tutorial mandates you to do so),
    you can open new terminal, then edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` file, then execute another `cargo run`.

    For example, if you want to run 3 (three) instances of BambangShop Receiver at port `8001`, `8002`, and `8003`, you can do these steps:
    -   Edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8001`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8002`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open another new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8003`, then execute `cargo run`.

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Subscriber) Reflections

#### Reflection Subscriber-1

1. In this tutorial, we used RwLock<> to synchronise the use of Vec of Notifications. Explain why it is necessary for this case, and explain why we do not use Mutex<> instead?

We can use something like RwLock<Vec<Notification>> to allow for multiple threads to read the list at the same time but reserve only one thread for writing when it is needed. This setup is needed because in our application reading notifications is much more frequent than writing. If we had used Mutex instead even read operations would lock the entire structure since it will only allow one thread total to access it whether it is reading or writing. This is not efficient where there is multiple reads and threads to do those reads. The use of Mutex would just slow down the performance during read-heavy operations. So RwLock is more efficient and makes more sense to use when there are more reads than writes.

2. In this tutorial, we used lazy_static external library to define Vec and DashMap as a “static” variable. Compared to Java where we can mutate the content of a static variable via a static function, why did not Rust allow us to do so?

The reason why we can't directly mutate static variables is because within Java static variables can be easily modified using static methods, the langauge does not enforce thread-safety rules. As for the circumstances within Rust, the thread safety is prioritized especially for data access by multithreads. Though, Rust doesn't allow mutable access to static variables by default. The reason for this is due to the possibility of data types or unpredictable behaviour. In addition, Rust requires Mutex, Rwlock, or Dashmap to operate safely. The lazy_static crate helps define and initialize complex static values and this can help with ensuring that shared data is safely accessible across threads. Rust has the benefit of emphasizing memory safety and concurrency guarantees.

#### Reflection Subscriber-2

1. Have you explored things outside of the steps in the tutorial, for example: src/lib.rs? If not, explain why you did not do so. If yes, explain things that you have learned from those other parts of code.

Yes, I have explored around the project since I did mess up a few times. I checked lib.rs and it helped me learn a bit more about the project structure for rust. I also checked that the lib.rs supported stuff like modularity. The use of moduels in Rust was super interesting since it is similar to other coding languages. I also check the cargo.toml and it contains all the dependencies nad its versions which is why I should be careful not to push it by accident. I also observed the structure of Rust and how to apply clean code through this structure.

2. Since you have completed the tutorial by now and have tried to test your notification system by spawning multiple instances of Receiver, explain how Observer pattern eases you to plug in more subscribers. How about spawning more than one instance of Main app, will it still be easy enough to add to the system?

The observer pattern made it very easy to plug in additional reciever instances or subscribers instances. without altering the core logic in notification and they should be integrated instantly. It is also very scalable since it encompasses many items and considerations. The drawback that there are some challenges for multiple app instances and shared state management.

3. Have you tried to make your own Tests, or enhance documentation on your Postman collection? If you have tried those features, tell us whether it is useful for your work (it can be your tutorial work or your Group Project).

I have not implemented tests outside the postman one given. I did annotate more on my Postman collection and it useful to help me understand what is being covered in that particular area or test. It will be helpful to teach my group members about what is being covered by the test.
